# Functional Connectivity Network Replicability Effects Repository
 
This repository contains all of the information and code required to download the data, run the analysis, and reproduce the results from our study on the effects of pipeline, band-pass filtering, and brain parcellation on the replicability of functional brain networks.

**Abstract:** Functional connectivity (FC) examines temporal dependencies among brain regions in an undirected network. Before estimating a subject's functional network, the data must be preprocessed, but there is no consensus on a single preprocessing stream, giving way to sources of heterogeneity, especially for multi-site data. The default mode network (DMN) is well studied, stable, and active when an individual is unfocused or at rest, making it ideal for studying how sources of heterogeneity affect the replicability of a functional connectivity network. We use the DMN as the tool for assessing the impact of preprocessing pipeline, band-pass filtering, and brain parcellation on functional connectivity for multi-site resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). We also provide practical recommendations for how researchers should proceed with preprocessing choices in the face of these effects.
