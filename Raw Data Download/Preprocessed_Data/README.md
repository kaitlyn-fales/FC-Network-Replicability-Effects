This empty folder is the directory that all of the raw data files from the ABIDE website will go to after running the Data_Download.R file. 

These files are used next in the Metadata and FC_Network_Generation folders, so the code in these folders will not work until the files are first downloaded from the ABIDE website. 

After all preprocessing, the final FC matrices can be found in the data files within the Correlation_Matrices folder, so you may use these data to reproduce the analyses if you prefer to not download the files directly.
