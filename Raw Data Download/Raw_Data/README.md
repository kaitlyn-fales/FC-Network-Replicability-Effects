This empty folder is the directory that all of the raw data files from the ABIDE website will go to after running the Data_Download.R file. 

These files are used next in the Metadata and FC_Network_Generation folders within Data Preprocessing, so the code in those folders will not work until the files are first downloaded from the ABIDE website.
