The contents of this folder are as follows:

**ComBat:** This folder contains the R scripts to reproduce the analysis described in the paper after performing ComBat harmonization to control for the site effect.

**Frobenius Norm:** This folder contains the R scripts to find the Frobenius norm of the difference in two FC matrices across all of the preprocessing combinations within each subject.

**LMM:** This folder contains the R scripts to construct the linear mixed effects models described in the paper, and regress out the random effect of site to control for the additional variation that the sites add to the data.

**UMAP:** This folder contains the script to run the UMAP algorithm described in the paper and project our six-dimensional network vector into two-dimensional space.
