The contents of this folder are as follows:

**ComBat:** This folder contains the R script to reproduce the analysis described in the paper after performing ComBat harmonization to control for the site effect.

**Exploratory Analysis:** This folder contains the R script and .RData file to reproduce the exploratory analysis in the manuscript. 

**Functional Network Block Structure:** This folder contains the R script to analyze the strength of the functional network block structure. 

**Intra-Subject Variability:** This folder contains the R scripts, .csv, and .RData files to find the Frobenius norm of the difference in two FC matrices and the portrait divergence across all of the preprocessing combinations within each subject.

**LMM:** This folder contains the R scripts to construct the linear mixed effects models described in the paper, and produce the data files used in the scripts for Functional Network Block Structure, UMAP, and Intra-Subject Variability. 

**UMAP:** This folder contains the script to run the UMAP algorithm described in the paper and project our 435-dimensional network vector into two-dimensional space.
